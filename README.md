### Abstract:
[//]: <> This is a user-friendly app that displays motivational posters. Users can generate random posters with the click of a button. If they like the poster made, they can save that poster to their favorites library. Adding to the interactivity, a user can input their own image URL, title, and quote to make their very own unique poster.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> 
- git clone this repo to your local machine
- cd into that directory
- git open index.html to open the browser
- Have fun making and saving your posters!


### Preview of App:

### Context:
[//]: <> The project was introduced to us 5 days before the due date. We worked together to block off time that would be dedicated to work on the project outside of class time for the 5 days. Despite us having a 2 hour time difference we clearly established norms and start/end times to our days.

We are both in our first module out of five in our program. We have officially completed 2 weeks of class.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> This was the first time that we worked on an actual application as well as reading HTML and CSS. Our learning goals were to be able to add functionality to this app by only updating the JavaScript file. We also wanted to learn how to write functions that actually had an event tied to it that we can see on the browser. Aside from technical code, we had a goal to understand how to use the remote repository to our advantage when working with others. We were able to push code one partner worked on into the remote repo and have the other partner pull the new code onto their local machine.

### Wins:
[//]: <> 
- Using querySelector to access a class used for sections and buttons and then creating a function to add or remove the class “hidden” from the classList so that features can be added/removed from view on a page. This is something that neither of us had experience with so it was nice to see it come together.
- Researching and using getElementById().value inside of a function to make an input variable an array that stores the images, titles, and quotes that a user inputs.
- Overall, we started to be able to come up with what code we should write on our own. It is hard to start from scratch, think of what you want to happen and run through all of the code that you have in your head to see which methods to use. It started to come more naturally towards the end.

### Challenges:
[//]: <> 
- We did not know how to stop an event listener so that another event could occur. We researched on our own and also contacted a mod 2 student to ask for help. Once we understood how it worked, we were able to work that into our code.
- Using innerHTML is not something that we had put into practice before. We looked ahead in the calendar and read through lessons on innerHTML in order to learn how to use it.
